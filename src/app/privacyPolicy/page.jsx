                Opting out of marketing and promotional communications: You can unsubscribe
                from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on
                the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, replying "STOP" or
                "UNSUBSCRIBE" to the SMS messages that we send, or by contacting us using
                the details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS
                NOTICE?" below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However,
                we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related
                messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account,
                to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.

            <h2>11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
            <p>
                Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
                include a Do-Not-Track "DNT" feature or setting you can activate to signal
                your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
                activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology
                standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As
                such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
                mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
                online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
                the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
                this privacy notice.
            </p>
            <p>
                California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT
                signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for
                recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.
            </p>
            <h2>12. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
            <p>
                In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant
                with relevant laws.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version
                will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date at the top of this privacy
                notice. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify
                you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly
                sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice
                frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
